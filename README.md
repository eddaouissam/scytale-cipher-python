# Scytale Cipher Encryption Tool

The Scytale Cipher Encryption Tool is a Python program implemented in Jupyter Notebook that allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using the ancient cryptographic technique known as the Scytale cipher.

## Description

The Scytale cipher is a transposition cipher that was used by the Spartans in ancient Greece for secure communication. It involves wrapping a strip of paper around a cylinder (called a Scytale) of a specific diameter and writing the message vertically along the cylinder. Once unwrapped, the message appears scrambled and unreadable. To decrypt the message, the recipient must possess a Scytale of the same diameter and wrap the paper around it to reveal the original message.

This Jupyter Notebook provides two functions:
- `scytale_encrypt(message, diameter)`: Encrypts a message using the Scytale cipher.
- `scytale_decrypt(encrypted_message, diameter)`: Decrypts an encrypted message using the Scytale cipher.

## Requirements

To run this Jupyter Notebook, you need:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.x: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install Jupyter Notebook: Open a terminal/command prompt and run the command `pip install jupyter`

## Usage

1. Download the `scytale_cipher_tool.ipynb` file.
2. Open Jupyter Notebook by running the command `jupyter notebook` in a terminal/command prompt.
3. In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the location where you saved the `scytale_cipher_tool.ipynb` file.
4. Click on the file to open it.
5. Follow the instructions within the notebook to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Scytale cipher.

## Usage Examples

```python
# Example Usage

message = "issam eddaou"
diameter = 4

# Encryption
Encrypted Message: i oseusd ad ma
#Decryption
Decrypted Message: issam eddaou 
```
